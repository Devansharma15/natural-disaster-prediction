ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Real-Time Natural Disaster Prediction System

Overview:
This project uses machine learning and geospatial data to forecast and visualize natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes in real time.

*Key Features:

1.Interactive map and dashboard
2.Real-time disaster monitoring
3.Predictive analysis (7-day forecasts)
4.Confidence scoring
5.Supports LSTM and Random Forest

*Tech Stack:

1.Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Folium
2.ML models (Random Forest, LSTM)
3.APIs: USGS, NOAA, NASA
